The chosen node
---------------

The chosen node does not represent a real device, but serves as a place
for passing data between firmware and the operating system, like boot
arguments. Data in the chosen node does not represent the hardware.


stdout-path property
--------------------

Device trees may specify the device to be used for boot console output
with a stdout-path property under /chosen, as described in ePAPR, e.g.

/ {
	chosen {
		stdout-path = "/serial@f00:115200";
	};

	serial@f00 {
		compatible = "vendor,some-uart";
		reg = <0xf00 0x10>;
	};
};

If the character ":" is present in the value, this terminates the path.
The meaning of any characters following the ":" is device-specific, and
must be specified in the relevant binding documentation.

For UART devices, the preferred binding is a string in the form:

	<baud>{<parity>{<bits>{<flow>}}}

where

	baud	- baud rate in decimal
	parity	- 'n' (none), 'o', (odd) or 'e' (even)
	bits	- number of data bits
	flow	- 'r' (rts)

For example: 115200n8r

Implementation note: Linux will look for the property "linux,stdout-path" or
on PowerPC "stdout" if "stdout-path" is not found.  However, the
"linux,stdout-path" and "stdout" properties are deprecated. New platforms
should only use the "stdout-path" property.

linux,booted-from-kexec
-----------------------

This property is set (currently only on PowerPC, and only needed on
book3e) by some versions of kexec-tools to tell the new kernel that it
is being booted by kexec, as the booting environment may differ (e.g.
a different secondary CPU release mechanism)

linux,usable-memory
-------------------

This property is set on PowerPC and arm64 by kexec-tools during kdump
to tell the crash kernel the base address of its reserved area of memory, and
the size. e.g.

/ {
	chosen {
		linux,usable-memory = <0x9 0xf0000000 0x0 0x10000000>;
	};
};

linux,elfcorehdr
----------------

This property is set (currently only on arm64) by kexec-tools during kdump
to tell the crash kernel the address and size of the elfcorehdr that describes
the old kernel's memory as an elf file. This memory must reside within the area
described by 'linux,usable-memory'. e.g.

/ {
	chosen {
		linux,usable-memory = <0x9 0xf0000000 0x0 0x10000000>;
		linux,elfcorehdr = <0x9 0xfffff000 0x0 0x800>;
	};
};
